        <p> The first season of <span class="ST">Stranger Things</span> premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016.
             It consists of eight episodes ranging from forty-two to fifty-five minutes in length. 
            Set in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana in 1983, the season is about the disappearance of Will Byers
             and the ensuing search for him by family, friends and the local authorities.
            
            Imagined by its creators as an eight-hour blockbuster film, it was inspired by and pays homage to classic genre films
             of the 1980s â€” in particular the films of Steven Spielberg and John Carpenter, as well as the novels of Stephen King. 
             The season received critical and audience acclaim and was praised for its directing, acting performances, 
             title sequence, and synth-heavy score.
